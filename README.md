Birds of NY is a digital card game made with React that helps people memorize common bird species that live in or visit Central Park in New York City. The game is inspired by [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), an open-source spaced-repetition software. Like Anki, users can use the keyboard commands to quickly navigate between cards. And as with Anki, repetition of difficult cards aids with memorization and recall. Visit the live project [here](https://birdsofny.netlify.app/).

**In this project I focused on:**

- Using custom hooks in React

**Future updates:**

- Top priority:
  - add to bird dataset - ideally all the birds from NYC Audobon list
  - Mobile compatibility
  - User authentication so that people can create custom decks of the birds they're working on memorizing
- Lower priority:
  - make cards draggable

**About the birds**
The game features birds from the NYC Audobon's [Annotated Checklist](https://www.nycaudubon.org/rails/active_storage/disk/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9JYTJWNVNTSWhZbWw2YTJ0MGJISTJNV2RrYlRKd2NIbDZhRzFtYlRSNmFYQnRjQVk2QmtWVU9oQmthWE53YjNOcGRHbHZia2tpYjJsdWJHbHVaVHNnWm1sc1pXNWhiV1U5SWtKcGNtUnpYMjltWDBObGJuUnlZV3hmVUdGeWF5MXZabVpwWTJsaGJDNXdaR1lpT3lCbWFXeGxibUZ0WlNvOVZWUkdMVGduSjBKcGNtUnpYMjltWDBObGJuUnlZV3hmVUdGeWF5MXZabVpwWTJsaGJDNXdaR1lHT3daVU9oRmpiMjUwWlc1MFgzUjVjR1ZKSWhSaGNIQnNhV05oZEdsdmJpOXdaR1lHT3daVSIsImV4cCI6IjIwMjItMTAtMDRUMDA6MTQ6MzIuNjYxWiIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2Jfa2V5In19--fa2b1bacb046180df7852cec4b34d7899474998b/Birds_of_Central_Park-official.pdf?content_type=application%2Fpdf&disposition=inline%3B+filename%3D%22Birds_of_Central_Park-official.pdf%22%3B+filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Birds_of_Central_Park-official.pdf) of the Birds of Central Park. The pictures of the birds are from [ebird.org](https://ebird.org/home), a crowd-sourced global birding database created by Cornell University's Lab of Ornithology.
